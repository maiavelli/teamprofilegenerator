# Team Profile Generator
![License: ISC](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-ISC-blue.svg)

This is a command line application that uses node.js to create a team roster with HTML. 

My motivation when creating this project was to further challenge my understanding of node and its packages, and to fully generate a clean and professional HTML page using only the command line, node.js and javascript.
